# **Alex Widman's R Data Analytics Portfolio**

Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio!

I am a data analyst specializing in social science analysis. This is a portfolio displaying some of the data analytics projects I have done in R specifically. These are a combination of both academic and professional (when permitted) projects.

Feel free to browse around and explore some of the work I have done!
