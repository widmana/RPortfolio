<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>This paper constructs statistical models to understand the
relationship between Social Vulnerability and CVAC level of concern for
vaccination rollout as well as strength of hesitancy to receive a
vaccine in the U.S. Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey (HPS). The
CDC’s Social Vulnerability Index codifies the extent to which a
community is socially vulnerable to a disaster. We wanted to see if the
average estimated percentage of survey respondents who were “Strongly
hesitant” was different among different categories of Social
Vulnerability. We also wanted to see if greater social vulnerability is
associated with supply-and demand-related challenges to the COVID-19
vaccine coverage (CVAC level of concern). In our statistical analyses,
we found statistically significant evidence that the average estimated
percentage of survey respondents who were “Strongly hesitant” was
different among different categories of Social Vulnerability. We also
found statistically significant evidence that the Social Vulnerability
Index (SVI) is an effective predictor of CVAC level of concern for
vaccination rollout.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Since the first case of coronavirus surfaced in a Chinese seafood and
poultry market in December of 2019, the virus has swept the globe. In
countries all over the world, the virus has “upended life and derailed
the global economy” (Taylor). More than 1.6 million have been killed and
more than 76 million have become sick due to the coronavirus (Taylor).
After over a year of mourning deaths and coping with sickness, adapting
to economic shutdowns and high unemployment rates, adjusting to life
with social distancing and masks, and everything in between, Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) approval of vaccines is a light at the end of
the tunnel. As more and more vaccines are produced and becoming
available, we wonder how social vulnerability plays a role in who gets
the vaccine and who is hesitant to do so. Using data from a sample of
3,142 counties, we are able to analyze the relationship between social
vulnerability and strength of hesitancy towards receiving the COVID-19
vaccine as well as CVAC level of concern towards vaccination
rollout[^1}.1 SVI indicates the relative vulnerability of every U.S.
Census tract and it ranks the tracts on 15 social factors, including
unemployment, minority status, and disability. Each tract receives a
ranking for each Census variable and for each of the four themes, as
well as an overall ranking (ATSDR). In this study, we want to see how
the degree of social vulnerability in communities impacts the ability to
prevent human suffering from the coronavirus. In consideration of social
vulnerability and receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, this study aims to
discover if at least two of the SVI categories’ averages estimated
strongly hesitant percentages are different. This will be tested using
the ANOVA test using the following hypotheses: (i) H<sub>0</sub>: the
average estimated “Strongly hesitant” percentages are similar throughout
all SVI Categories vs Ha: at least two of the SVI Categories’ average
estimated “Strongly hesitant” percentages are different. Secondly, this
study tests to see if SVI is an effective predictor of CVAC level of
concern for vaccination rollout using the following hypotheses: (ii)
H<sub>0</sub>: The population slope is zero (β = 0), Social
Vulnerability Index (SVI) is not an effective predictor of CVAC level of
concern for vaccination rollout vs Ha: The population slope is non-zero
(β 6= 0), Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) is an effective predictor of
CVAC level of concern for vaccination rollout.</p>

<div id="data" class="section level1">
<h1>Data</h1>
<p>The data used in this dataset was based on 3,142 unique values of
counties and was collected from data.gov, which collected data from the
U.S. Census Bureau’s HPS. The HPS is a 20 minute online survey that
studies how the coronavirus pandemic is impacting households,
individuals, families, and communities across the country from a social
and economic perspective (US Census Bureau HPS). One of the questions on
the HPS asks, “Once a vaccine to prevent COVID-19 is available to you,
would you get a vaccine?” Five responses were available: definitely get
a vaccine, probably get a vaccine, unsure, probably not get a vaccine,
and definitely not get a vaccine (CDC Estimates). Three definitions
captured the strength of the hesitancy: strongly hesitant (included
“definitely not” responses), hesitant (included “probably not” or
definitely not” responses), and hesitant/unsure (included “probably
not,” “unsure,” and “definitely not” responses) (CDC Estimates). The
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approved the collection of this
study, in which the Census Bureau randomly chose addresses, not
individuals personally, to participate in this survey. Hesitancy rates
were measured in two steps. First, hesitancy rates at the state level
were measured using the HPS for the collection period April 14 2021-
April 26, 2021 (CDC Estimates). Then the estimated values were used to
predict hesitancy rates in more granular areas using the Census Bureau’s
2019 American Community Survey (ACS) 1-year Public Use Microdata Sample
(PUMS). Secondly, hesitancy rates at the county level were estimated
using a Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA)-to-county crosswalk from the
Missouri Census Data Center. “PUMAs spanning multiple counties had their
estimates apportioned across those counties based on overball 2010
Census populations” (CDC Estimates). This explains how the variables
“Estimated hesitancy” and “Estimated strongly hesitant” in the dataset
were collected. The demographic data came from the 2019 ACS 5-year
estimates. The ACS is an ongoing survey that provides data every year
that covers a broad range of topics about social, economic, demographic,
and housing characteristics of the U.S. population (US Census Bureau
5-Year Data). The multi-year estimate increases statistical reliability
of the data for less populated areas and small population subgroups.
This explains how the variables “Percent Hispanic” and “Percent
non-Hispanic American Indian/ Alaska Native” in the dataset were
collected. Other variables in this dataset include “County name,”
“State,” and “Percent adults fully vaccinated” and these came from the
CDC Data Tracker. Another variable in the dataset was “SVI” which was
obtained from the 2018 CDC SVI. SVI indicates the relative vulnerability
of every U.S. Census tract, which are subdivisions of counties for which
the Census collects statistical data. SVI ranks the tracts on 15 social
factors, including unemployment, minority status, and disability, and
further groups them into four related themes. Thus, each tract receives
a ranking for each Census variable and for each of the four themes, as
well as an overall ranking (ATSDR). Lastly, the “CVAC” variable was
measured. The CVAC acknowledges that not every community will face the
same barriers, thus it narrows down to the county level and shows
precisely which barriers each U.S. community is likely to face in
achieving high vaccine coverage and why (Surgo Venturer). There are five
barriers to consider: Historic Undervaccination, Sociodemographic
Barriers, Resource-Constrained Healthcare System, Healthcare
Accessibility Barriers, and Irregular Care Seeking Behavior. The CVAC
measures the level of concern for a difficult rollout on a range from 0
(lowest concern) to 1 (highest concern). The CVAC Index can also be
categorized as follows: Very Low (0.0-0.19), Low (0.20-0.39), Moderate
(0.40-0.59), High (0.60-0.79), or Very High (0.80-1.0) Concern (CDC
Estimates).</p>

<h1>Results</h1>
<p>For our data, we used a sample of 3,142 different counties to observe
how Social Vulnerability is associated with with average estimated
percentage of “Strongly hesitant” respondents and CVAC level of concern
for vaccination rollout. <strong>Hypothesis (i)</strong> In order to
test hypothesis i, we used ANOVA to test the differences in average
estimated “Strongly hesitant” percentages among Social Vulnerability
Categories. For this permutation test, we used the α = 0.05 significance
level to determine whether to to reject or accept H<sub>0</sub>. In the
boxplot of SVI Category versus estimated “Strongly hesitant” below, the
5-number summary for Low concern is approximately (0.03, 0.07, 0.08,
0.010, 0.014) with a handful of outliers that might be significant. The
5-number summary for moderate concern is approximately (0.03, 0.07,
0.08, 0.10, 0.14) with a few outliers that probably are not significant.
The 5-number summary for moderate concern is approximately (0.03, 0.07,
0.08, 0.10, 0.14) with a few outliers that probably are not significant.
The 5-number summary for very high concern concern is approximately
(0.04, 0.08, 0.11, 0.12, 0.17) with one outlier. The 5-number summary
for very low concern concern is approximately (0.01, 0.06, 0.08, 0.10,
0.15) with a few outliers.</p>
<p>Testing for ANOVA:</p>
<p>Both the normality condition and the equal variance condition are
met.</p>
<p>The p-value is &lt;2e-16, so using α = 0.05, we have statistically
significant evidence that atleast two of the SVI Categories’ average
estimated strongly hesitant percentage are different. The Tukey HSD test
showed that there are statistically significantly differences in the
average proportion of “Estimated Strongly Hesitant” respondents between
all but three pairs; Moderate Concern and Low Concern, Very Low Concern
and Low Concern, and Very Low Concern and Moderate Concern.
<strong>Hypothesis (ii)</strong> In order to test hypothesis ii, we used
an inference for regression to test whether the ocial Vulnerability
Index (SVI) is an effective predictor of CVAC level of concern for
vaccination rollout. For this permutation test, we used the α = 0.05
significance level to determine whether to to reject or accept
H<sub>0</sub>.</p>
